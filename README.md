The data can be downloaded from the link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dolbokostya/test-dataset.
<br>The Preliminary Experiments notebook demonstrates an initial attempt to utilize different models on our dataset.
<br>The Model Implementation notebook demonstrates the data preprocessing and model building with basic models like Logic regression and LSTM, and with more advanced BERT models. 
<br>NOTE: Tensorflow with GPU acceleration needs to be set up correctly in order for the code to work for BERT. TensorFlow 2.10 was the last version that supports Windows and hence CUDA Toolkit 11.2 and cuDNN 8.1. is required to be used if the user operates on Windows. Details of setting up can be find here: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source#gpu
